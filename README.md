## Let's start playing with data!
We have been looking at the MINST dataset composed of hand written digits with 10 different labels. 
You can download it here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

We will look at a more recent dataset called Fashion-MNIST dataset.
* you can download this cool dataset here:
https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
this dataset is called Fashion-MNIST dataset and is a dataset of Zalando's article images. Fashion-MNIST is a 28x28 grayscale image of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The training set has 60,000 images, and the test set has 10,000 images. 

Fashion-MNIST training and test splits are similar to the original MNIST dataset. It also consists of 10 labels, but instead of handwritten digits, you have 10 different labels of fashion accessories like sandals, shirt, trousers, etc.

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

0 T-shirt/top
1 Trouser
2 Pullover
3 Dress
4 Coat
5 Sandal
6 Shirt
7 Sneaker
8 Bag
9 Ankle boot
